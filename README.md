# WixWebSiteTemplateCloned
A personal project for my training , I clone this wix web site template that I encountered the template on dribbble.com ,
I made by visualising the only the picture of the template without any figma file ,
so I tried to challenge myself by building this site of three pages 
by using HTML and CSS, I have added as well some hover effects on the links of the pages ,
The result of work below with some screenshorts
